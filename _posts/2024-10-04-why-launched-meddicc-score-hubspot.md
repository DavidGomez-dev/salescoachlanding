### The Challenges of Traditional Sales Methodologies

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been a huge fan of traditional sales methodologies like MEDDICC, BANT, SPICED and others. My first encounter with MEDDICC was at [Prescinto, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prescinto/), introduced by Hugo Lapie, who had successfully implemented it in his previous role at a U.S. company.

We gave it a shot for a while, but eventually, we stopped using it. The main reason? The **process was time-consuming and cumbersome**, especially in HubSpot. We used to fill out an Excel sheet with responses, then upload it to HubSpot. It was boring, tedious, and took away from our focus on what really matters‚Äî**building relationships and closing deals**.

These frameworks provide a structured approach, ensuring that no critical details are overlooked and that sales teams can consistently assess the strength of each deal. For Sales Directors, MEDDICC offers us the added **advantage of greater visibility into the sales pipeline**, making it easier to forecast revenue, identify potential roadblocks early, and provide targeted coaching to our teams. However, the traditional way of implementing them felt like it was slowing us down rather than helping us succeed.

### A Better Solution for HubSpot

That got me thinking: What if there was a simpler, **more streamlined way to integrate this methodology directly into HubSpot**? As a Sales Director who loves HubSpot, I knew there had to be a better solution. After some research, I found that others on Reddit and the HubSpot Community were facing the same challenges. It was clear the problem hadn‚Äôt been solved yet.

During my summer vacation, I decided to put **my amateur coding skills to work**. I built a HubSpot app that makes it easier and more visual to use MEDDICC within HubSpot. Here‚Äôs how it works:

#### 1. Visual Score on the Deals Sidebar

The score appears directly on the Deals sidebar on the right, with a visual indicator showing the current score and highlighting which categories are complete or still need attention.

#### 2. Streamlined Data Entry

By clicking on ‚ÄúUpdate Score,‚Äù users are taken to a form where they can easily input the necessary information. The score is automatically calculated based on the completed fields, saving time and effort.

#### 3. Change Qualification Framework

By selecting an option from the dropdown menu, you can switch to other qualification frameworks, such as **MEDDICC, BANT, GPCTBA/C&I, SPICED, FAINT, CHAMP, SCOTSMAN, or ANUM**.

### Pricing:

The app is free for the first 5 deals with a score, and after that, it‚Äôs just $29 USD per month. I think it‚Äôs a fair price, especially for companies investing heavily in professional CRMs. I offer a 19$USD launching offer too!

### Building a HubSpot App

Building a [HubSpot](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hubspot/) app turned out to be a rewarding experience. HubSpot‚Äôs API is incredibly detailed, making it easy to interact with the platform. Most of the functionality works within an iframe, which is convenient. Authentication was a bit more complex, but the use of scopes for permissions is an elegant solution that keeps everything secure.

### What‚Äôs Next:

I‚Äôm eager to see how this initial version is received by the market, and then define the roadmap with the feedback.

I‚Äôm excited to share this with you all and **would love to hear your feedback**! If you‚Äôre using HubSpot and have been looking for a way to streamline your sales qualification process, give it a try. And if you‚Äôre not using HubSpot yet, this might be the perfect reason to start. **Thank you for your support, and happy selling**!
