## How to Use the MEDDICC Tool to Boost Sales

### 1. Analyze Every Deal with MEDDICC

Apply the MEDDICC checklist to each opportunity. Evaluate where you have strengths or gaps. Is there a clear economic buyer? Do you know the prospect’s key metrics?

### 2. Focus on Identifying Pain Early

Understanding your prospect’s pain points is key to offer relevant solutions. The MEDDICC tool ensures you don’t skip this foundational step.

### 3. Map Out the Decision Process

Sales slow down when you’re unclear about the buying process. Use the MEDDICC framework to clarify who is involved in decisions and what steps are required from first meeting to closed deal.

### 4. Engage Your Champion

A project champion can be the difference between a stalled deal and a closed-won opportunity. Identify and empower them using MEDDICC.

### 5. Keep Tabs on the Competition

Know who else is vying for your prospect’s business. MEDDICC helps you anticipate competitive threats and adapt your approach.

### 6. Regular Deal Reviews

Use the MEDDICC tool to regularly review open deals. Account for each component, spot red flags, and develop strategies to address weaknesses.
